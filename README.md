**Custom Mesh Generator for vertexes(left)**

In order to freely transform the shape like the actual ceramic manufacturing process, far more vertexes were required than the cylinder object provided by Unity, and this was implemented through the Custom Mesh Generator script.

**Mesh Deformer in VR**

The mesh can be transformed even within the VR environment by using the Mesh Deformer script. Now, controller is used for carving, but in the future, it will be changed to provide a feeling of brushing by hand.(Now, we can do it!)
